            explain: "Fibrinoid necrosis occurs in blood vessels, particularly in immune reactions (e.g., vasculitis) and hypertensive emergencies.  It involves the deposition of immune complexes and fibrin in the vessel walls, giving them a bright pink, amorphous appearance under the microscope.",

            select: "",
            explain: "Euchromatin is loosely packed, making DNA accessible to transcription machinery. Heterochromatin is densely packed, making genes inaccessible for transcription.  This reflects the relationship between chromatin structure and gene regulation.",

            select: "",
            explain: "Low-dose aspirin primarily targets COX-1, the enzyme responsible for thromboxane A2 synthesis in platelets.  Thromboxane A2 promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.  By inhibiting COX-1, aspirin reduces the risk of blood clot formation (thrombosis) that could occlude micro-arteries.",

            answer: "Bilirubin (bile pigment)",
            select: "",
            explain: "Jaundice and elevated bilirubin indicate impaired bile flow. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, gives bile its yellowish color and can accumulate in tissues, including the gallbladder mucosa, when bile flow is obstructed, causing the characteristic yellow discoloration of jaundice.",
